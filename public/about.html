<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Meir Zaks and I am a 20 years old guy who loves programming,
  reading, writing, hiking and most
  importantly, living.

  I live in Israel, and serve in the IDF, and do side projects in my spare free time.

      Learning code as deeply as possible in order to become an expert!
